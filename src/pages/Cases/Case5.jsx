            MANAGEMENTT
          </h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            Peru is a nation of more than 30 million inhabitants and has a
            territory of 1,285,000 km2 . Its identity can be explained by its
            tremendous cultural, biological and geographical diversity,
            something which makes it one of the world’s most megadiverse
            countries. The National Biodiversity Strategy (2021) promotes
            biodiversity and ecosystems as an essential part of the country’s
            natural capital. This capital has historically provided the basis
            and sustenance for social, cultural and economic development. <br />
            <br />
            The management of protected areas is considered to be a key part of
            sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem services and fostering
            sustainable development in the country, including climate change
            mitigation measures. Nevertheless, mobilising the required
            financial, human and institutional resources remains a challenge. As
            a subordinate agency of the Ministry of Environment, the National
            Service of Protected Natural Areas (Servicio Nacional de Áreas
            Naturales Protegidas por el Estado, SERNANP) is the governing body
            for the management of the National System of Natural Areas Protected
            by the State (Sistema Nacional de Áreas Naturales Protegidas por el
            Estado, SINANPE). Established in 1990, SINANPE currently comprises
            76 nationally administered protected areas. Complementing SINANPE
            and working under the same legal protection framework, regional
            governments and civil society manage regional and private
            conservation areas respectively (these voluntary conservation
            efforts are recognised by the national government and, in the latter
            case, managed by individual landowners or their representatives).
            SINANPE has experienced steady growth (the number of areas under
            national administration has risen from 40 in 2003 to 76 in 2018). At
            the same time, conditions for effective management are improving, as
            can be observed by the fact that, while in 2003 only 33 protected
            areas were staffed and 17 had master plans for their management, in
            2015 61 were staffed and 41 had master plans (OECD 2016). The
            implementation of SINANPE is financed primarily through public funds
            and revenue generation from tourism. Financing is supplemented by
            international funds which are mostly channelled and partly managed
            through the Fund for the Promotion of Protected Natural Areas of
            Peru (Fondo de Promoción de las Áreas Naturales Protegidas del Perú,
            PROFONANPE) and private funds, for instance, from private carbon
            markets.

          <h4>&gt;&gt; MAIN CHALLENGES</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            Peru has been experiencing significant economic growth for over two
            decades now. Ecosystems face growing pressure from large-scale
            infrastructure, hydroelectric and mining projects, expansion of the
            agricultural frontier, unplanned urbanisation, deforestation and
            climate change. All of these developments threaten the flow of
            nature´s benefits to society and undermine what could be the
            foundations of solid long-term growth. Thus, the management of
            biodiversity and ecosystem services inside and outside protected
            areas and the development of an interconnected network of core
            areas, buffer zones and corridors are key to balancing development
            needs and nature conservation. The main challenges to protected area
            management can be summarised under the following topics: <br />
            <br />
            <ol>
              <li className="p-1">
                <b>
                  The creation of effective and equitable governance and
                  management structures, especially inter-institutional
                  coordination and cooperation, including clearly demarcated
                  protected area and zone boundaries, remains a challenge.

                  <li className="p-1">
                    Peru’s biodiversity is unique, but most of it is situated in
                    large protected areas that are highly inaccessible. This
                    makes it difficult to ensure adequate monitoring. There is a
                    lack of control and monitoring capacities to generate
                    management-relevant information on the degree of risk to
                    protected areas and the effective enforcement of
                    environmental regulations in buffer zones. Moreover, the
                    process of adequately demarcating PA boundaries is very
                    costly

                    Improvements in the quality of management plans for
                    protected areas and a clear strategic orientation – taking
                    into account the links with other development plans – are
                    only slowly taking hold. Many protected areas in the system
                    have developed and been implemented in diverse and
                    nonsystematic ways, without following a logical, planned
                    sequence.

                    The roles that each level and sector of government have to
                    play in the ongoing decentralisation process are yet to be
                    fully clarified and defined. For example, the competencies
                    of regional governments are often un-clear, and they have
                    very limited resources and structures for carrying out
                    effective work as development actors. Besides managing
                    Regional Conservation Areas, the regions have also assumed
                    greater responsibility under the process of decentralisation
                    for territorial planning and environmental and natural
                    resource management.

                    Despite significant increases in annual budget
                    appropriations (from USD 2.2 million to approximately USD 17
                    million between 2009 and 2016), the resources provided for
                    effective protected area management have not kept pace with
                    the growth of the protected area system (GEF 2017). Further
                    investments, also on the part of regional governments and
                    the private sector, are needed in order to ensure the
                    long-term viability and coverage of the running costs for
                    SINANPE as a whole.

                    Financial planning for protected areas is not always
                    sufficiently linked to conservation outcomes and performance
                    benchmarks, while financial administration capacities are
                    poor in many cases. Strategic conservation planning and
                    long-term financial planning are insufficiently integrated
                    and development of financial mechanisms to supplement the
                    public budget is limited (GEF 2017). Additional potential
                    for reducing management costs through participatory and
                    collaborative mechanisms, such as inter-institutional and
                    cross-sectoral cooperation/budget articulation, conservation
                    agreements, public- private partnerships and management
                    contracts, remains untapped.

                    Tourism is considered a major driver of revenue generation,
                    yet the potential of tourism for enhancing protected areas
                    is yet to be exploited. According to a study (MINAM, 2010),
                    tourism in the country generates USD 3.5 billion each year,
                    of which 80% is linked to 11 protected areas. The promotion
                    of basic tourism infrastructure (such as environmental
                    information centres, hiking trails) and tourism services can
                    provide significant impetus for development and also
                    contribute to the creation of jobs in the park
                    administration and surrounding area. The granting of usage
                    rights plays an important role in this context.

          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            Peru and Germany have a longstanding history of cooperation, and the
            conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity (inside and outside
            protected areas) has always been an important element in this
            cooperation relationship. In the last two decades, support for
            SINANPE, especially SERNANP, regional governments and other
            stakeholders of protected area management in the country has been
            channelled principally through relatively large environmental
            programmes, with broad thematic approaches and a large number of
            partner institutions. Essentially, the advisory approach for
            technical cooperation in protected area management has evolved over
            time from providing support to single protected areas towards
            employing a systemic multi-level and multi-partner approach
            following programme building in the green sector of German
            cooperation to support the consolidation of the national system
            SINANPE. The characteristics and focal areas of the advisory
            approaches, adopted in response to the challenges identified in the
            previous section, in the different phases can be summarised as

                The alignment of advisory processes within the Peruvian
                institutional landscape and regulatory frameworks with the logic
                of the state’s functional systems, such as SINANPE, is of great

                The enhancement of any conservation tool, such as protected
                areas, through development cooperation must follow the explicit
                and implicit policy guidelines of the relevant sector at
                national level. The fact that it has been identified as a local
                technical need might not be enough, since, without a sufficient
                legal framework to support it, the sustainability of the
                advisory services provided is fragile.

                ADeveloping the capacity of SERNANP as the governing body of
                protected areas to coordinate and articulate matters with other
                sectors and stakeholder groups is key to achieving a shared

                The national policy for modernising public administration

                The impact of technical advisory services is increased when
