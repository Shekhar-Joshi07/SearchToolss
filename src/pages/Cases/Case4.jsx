            The overall objective of the project is: ‘The lakes’ natural
            resources are managed on a transboundary basis and in compliance
            with EU environmental and biodiversity protection targets’. In order
            to achieve this, the project focuses on protected areas (PAs) as
            instruments for biodiversity conservation as well as other mutually
            re-enforcing interventions:
            <ul>
              <li className="p-1">
                institutional strengthening of regional organisations relevant
                to the transboundary management of lakes and watersheds;
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                supporting lake-wide fisheries management in accordance with
                European standards and regulations; and
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                initiating lake-wide monitoring programmes in compliance with
                the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and nature conservation

              </li>
            </ul>{" "}
            <br />
            Such a multi-pronged approach focusing on the larger landscape or
            ecosystem level is common for PA-related projects in the context of
            technical development cooperation. Local PA agencies participated in
            some of these interventions, e.g. in fisheries management and in
            establishing the conservation status of species and habitats of
            common interest to riparian countries. With regard to PAs in a
            narrower sense, the project aimed to establish strict protection
            zones at each lake, with a view to developing species action plans,
            and to build general management capacity.

          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The forests on both sides of the border between Honduras and
            Nicaragua The lakes are exceptionally rich in biodiversity and
            endemism and therefore an important part of European natural
            heritage. <br />
            <br />
            Complex and overlapping patchworks of nationally and internationally
            designated PAs cover the Ohrid and Prespa lakes and their
            surroundings, including the transboundary Ohrid-Prespa UNESCO
            Biosphere Reserve (Albania and North Macedonia), Prespa National
            Park and Ohrid Protected Landscape in Albania and Galic˘ica National
            Park in North Macedonia (which includes the islands of Prespa and
            the Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ohrid Region under
            consideration for UNESCO World Heritage nomination). In the case of
            Lake Prespa, Greek territories are also included. The Albanian part
            of Lake Shkodra/Skadar is a Protected Landscape and the Montenegrin
            part a National Park.
            <br />
            <br />
            All the riparian countries are members of the Drin Core Group (DCG),
            the precursor to a Drin River Basin Commission covering the three
            lake sub-basins. However, the potential for coordinated
            transboundary governance to protect these ecosystems has not yet
            been fully met. This has compromised sustainable water and natural
            resources management in line with relevant EU directives. As a
            consequence, the lakes have been increasingly affected by threats
            and pressures related to agriculture, pollution from sewage systems,
            overfishing, tourism and the development of associated
            infrastructure, particularly along the shorelines.

                specific objective to strengthen and/or establish strict
                protection of areas or species. Concerns on the part of local
                resource users about potential use limitations were shared by
                some government representatives, resulting in different
                perspectives on the purpose and (future) use of these areas.{" "}

                a multiplicity of different interests and related organisational

                e.g. fisheries, water and sanitation, agriculture and tourism
                development, but without much consideration of interlinkages
                between different uses and objectives. There were also
                differences in understanding between government institutions and
                NGOs. Even where agreement on management objectives for
                individual PAs was reached, this was not necessarily sufficient
                for successful PA management since objectives were often not
                aligned with those established for the parts of the lakes and
                their wider catchment areas not under protection.

                ineffective in terms of providing practical guidance. This may
                have contributed to conflicts between conservation on the one
                hand and (infrastructure) development and resource use interests

                PAs in the region. However, financing remains a constraint to
                effective PA management and monitoring. The financial situation
                of PAs differs from one lake to another, with the Albanian part
                of Lake Shkodra/Skadar, for example, facing particular

          <h4>&gt;&gt; PROJECT APPROACH</h4>

          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The project adopted a broad approach aimed at developing expertise
            and strengthening inter-ministerial and transboundary cooperation,
            thereby supporting ministries and downstream authorities responsible
            for nature conservation, water management and fisheries in their
            efforts to implement the EU Water Framework Directive and EU nature
            conservation legislation. All interventions, including those not
            specifically aimed at improving the functioning of PAs, were
            designed to contribute to improving the conservation status of the
            lakes. <br />
            <br /> The overall intervention fields broadly correspond to the
            success factors identified for PAs and related challenges:
            <ul>
              <li className="p-1">
                By cooperating with a multiplicity of partners, the project

                among environmental ministries, PA agencies, fisheries
                authorities and fishing associations, research institutions,
                nature conservation NGOs and municipalities for improved
                cooperation, better biodiversity management and more effective
                monitoring at transboundary, national and local levels.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                Based on a shared commitment by partners to work towards and
                comply with the EU environmental framework (acquis
                communautaire), the project facilitated dialogue between
                ministries responsible for environment and bio-diversity
                conservation1 , water management and fisheries and their
                subordinate agencies, NGOs and municipalities as well as

                To this end, institutions were supported in setting up regional
                technical working groups (TWGs) on the WFD, biodiversity
                conservation and fisheries.

              <li className="p-1">
                The TWGs – along with the Drin Core Group – were systematically
                used to leverage alignment among multiple conservation and
                resources management agendas and initiatives both within and
                across lake sub-basins.

                fishers), who were involved in the formulation of fisheries

                Surveys and monitoring activities (e.g. fish spawning areas) and
                the mapping of lakeshore structures and habitats were conducted
                to create a sound basis for the{" "}
                <b>delimitation of strict protection zones</b> within PAs. As
                local municipalities build on this information, PAs will more

                the lakes, particularly in their shore zones.

              <li className="p-1">
                While the project did not engage in PA management planning
                directly, it did build capacity for biodiversity monitoring –
                with technical backstopping for project partners such as
                EuroNatur2 – as a key prerequisite for adaptive PA management.
                It used species action planning to design conservation measures
                for several bat species and the Dalmatian pelican. This
                contributed to an overall strengthening of the{" "}
                <b>capacities for monitoring and conservation management</b> of
                PA administrations and their partners.

            <br />
            <br />
            Few methods and tools included in the toolbox were used. The context
            of EU integration meant that the focus was on EU instruments rather
            than globally applicable tools and methods. Another reason was that
            biodiversity conservation was approached as a cross-cutting issue by
            this project. <br />
            <br />
            In order to diversify PA governance and introduce co-management of
            entire PAs or of certain resources (e.g. fish), the IUCN WCPA
            Guidelines Governance of Protected Areas: From understanding to
            action (Borrini-Feyerabend et al. 2013) were consulted.

                understanding among countries was facilitated, including
                discussion of bilateral agreements on transboundary
                collaboration and resources management. Furthermore, a fisheries
                agreement was drafted for Lake Shkodra/Skadar (Albania and

                overseen implementation of joint monitoring programmes in
                compliance with the EU WFD and nature conservation legislation
                and maintain close links with the DCG. They also proposed
                measures for using natural resources sustainably, protecting
                biodiversity and improving the ecological status of the lakes.
                Effective implementation of these measures will contribute to
                improving water quality and the ecological status of the three
                lake ecosystems.

                Management of the core breeding zone for Dalmatian pelicans at
                Lake Skadar (Montenegro) has improved, leading to increased
                breeding success of this charismatic yet vulnerable flagship
                species.

                Public awareness of nature conservation was increased, e.g.
                through high media coverage of project activities and other
                events, such as UN International Day for Biological Diversity,
                World Wetlands Day and Biodiversity Summer Schools.

                Up to 2017, much effort had been put into conducting surveys and
                developing monitoring capacity, as a prerequisite for successful
                PA management. During the current phase, emphasis has shifted
                towards developing tangible mechanisms to use the information
                generated to inform decision-making and management.

                There is a need to institutionalise frameworks for
                cross-sectoral and transboundary cooperation, such as the DCG
                and Lake Commissions, in order to make cooperation sustainable
                and effective. This is another main direction of the current
                phase.

                In PAs subject to infrastructure development and diverging
                resource-use interests, it is crucial to bring those who have a
                strong influence on conservation success but potentially
                conflicting interests to the table. This may include ministries
                in charge of agriculture, fisheries, finance and infrastructure
                development as well as businesses.

                In order to make PAs successful in complex stakeholder
                environments, it is important to understand both the official
                and the hidden agendas of the various actors. It is equally
                important to foster dialogue between competing stakeholders at
                an early stage and at an informal level in order to avoid
                entrenched positions later on.{" "}
