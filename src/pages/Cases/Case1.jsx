          <h4>&gt;&gt; CONTEXT</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The forests on both sides of the border between Honduras and
            Nicaragua are among the most biodiverse areas in the world. They
            form the core zone of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor and are
            home to various indigenous peoples. Unchecked logging, forest fires
            and clearance of forest land to make way for agriculture and
            livestock farming – facilitated by corruption, political influence,
            unresolved land tenure issues and drug-related crime etc. – are
            causing progressive deforestation. This is constraining not only the
            key ecological functions of the forest, but also the resources on
            which the lives and livelihoods of the (mostly indigenous) rural
            population depend. <br />
            <br />
            In both countries, the indigenous territories of the project region
            are located in or close to protected areas: the Bosawás Biosphere
            Reserve in Nicaragua and the Río Plátano and Tawahka Asangni
            biosphere reserves and Patuca National Park in Honduras. <br />
            <br />
            In Nicaragua, difficult political circumstances meant that the
            project had to be temporarily suspended, hence it was only able to
            instigate sporadic local initiatives. The remarks below therefore
            relate chiefly to Hondura

        <div className="pt-2 pb-4">
          <h4>&gt;&gt; CHALLENGES</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            In Honduras the relationship between indigenous organisations and
            the government institutions responsible for the protected areas was
            difficult and fraught with conflict. Neither side had sufficient
            financial, organisational and technical capacities to participate in
            processes of constructive negotiation. <br />
            <br />
            Often the actors involved also lacked the will to engage in such
            processes. The idea of protected areas, for instance, was rejected
            by most of the indigenous actors as a Western concept. The only
            relevant issue as far as they were concerned was land title. There
            was no common understanding of the purpose of the protected areas
            and how to manage them, either among the indigenous peoples, or
            between them and the responsible national agency for forest and
            nature conservation (Instituto Nacional de Conservación y Desarrollo
            Forestal, Áreas Protegidas y Vida Silvestre – ICF, Honduras). There
            were no joint structures for governance and management.

          <h4>&gt;&gt; APPROACH</h4>
          <h6 className="text-center">
            &gt; THE CONSULTATION PROCESS – FREE, PRIOR AND INFORMED CONSENT
            (FPIC)
          </h6>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            During the project appraisal phase the indigenous communities
            demanded a consultation process. Both GIZ and the governments
            promised to deliver this. However, time constraints meant that the
            process could only be partially launched during the appraisal phase.
            Based on ILO 169, an agreement was therefore reached between GIZ and
            the indigenous peoples, and between GIZ and BMZ, to implement a
            consultation process when the project was launched. This meant that
            in the project offer, two out of three results indicators at the
            level of objectives were formulated in general terms only so as to
            provide broad guidance. It was envisaged that they would be defined
            in specific detail through the consultation process, once the
            project was launched. <br />
            <br />
            This process was conducted in the four indigenous project areas in
            Nicaragua and Honduras with the aim of obtaining the indigenous
            communities’ free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) for the
            project. A total of 24 meetings with over 2,000 people were
            organised. In each case, the first step here was to obtain basic
            ‘approval’ for the project to commence work in the indigenous
            territories, provided that evaluation and coordination mechanisms
            involving the traditional structures of the indigenous peoples were
            in place. <br />
            <br />
            After that, issues of importance to the indigenous communities were
            identified and discussed. To structure the 191 topics identified,
            these were assigned to the project’s three areas of activity
            (promotion of economic alterntives in the protected areas, capacity
            development for the indigenous peoples and their organisations, and
            promoting and establishing local and binational consultation and
            coordination mechanisms). In a further participatory process, the
            topics were prioritised and the project activities resulting from
            them were defined. Similarly, objectives indicators for quality of
            life were specified in line with the indigenous worldview. <br />
            <br /> The topics that went beyond the scope of the project (a total
            of 335 are listed), and for which the indigenous communities
            requested external support, were forwarded to relevant institutions.
            The indigenous communities in Honduras sought to use the opportunity
            provided by the consultation process as a ‘megaphone’ through which
            to communicate their most important needs to the government and
            other actors (land title, education, health etc.). Since this was
            the first channel through which the indigenous communities had
            voiced their needs to the government, this was an indication that
            they placed a very high degree of trust in the project.

            &gt; GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES (FPIC)
          </h6>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            In conjunction with the third area of activity, which involved
            creating consultation and coordination mechanisms, the project
            promoted dialogue between government agencies and indigenous
            umbrella organisations – particularly in Honduras. It also focused
            on mainstreaming and designing coordination mechanisms for joint
            management of the protected areas. The trust established among the
            indigenous communities through the inclusive consultation process
            created an enabling environment for the two sides to grow closer
            together. An international workshop conducted by the project at the
            outset on the topic of indigenous communities and protected areas in
            Honduras, which included examples of co-management in Colombia,
            acted as a catalyst in the process of open dialogue between the
            indigenous communities and the responsible government institutions.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            Towards the end of the project, the national forest and nature
            conservation agency and the umbrella organisations of the various
            indigenous peoples in the project region in Honduras signed
            declarations of intent concerning the co-management of the protected
            areas in question. Concerning processes for consulting indigenous
            communities (FPIC) in general, and the amendment of forestry
            legislation, basic ideas were jointly discussed and subsequently fed
            into the parliamentary legislative process by the responsible
            bodies. The amendment of forestry legislation is designed to
            incorporate indigenous values and rights, and thus for instance
            enable forests to be communally owned instead of being either
            government-owned or privately owned as was the case to date, and
            establish an indigenous forest standard. This will make it possible
            to transfer to private structures some of the sovereign tasks of
            forest management, such as granting permits for logging for private
            purposes (e.g. house construction), which those affected would
            otherwise have to apply for at the forest management offices, which
            are usually very far away.
            <br />
            <br />
            Due to the low presence of state structures in the remote and
            sometimes poorly accessible project region in both countries,
            promoting local governance structures was essential. Together with
            the local indigenous population, maps were drawn up for six Miskito
            territories. These maps formed the basis for development planning
            and rules of use in the indigenous territories aligned with the
            principles of sustainability and the objectives of the biological
            corridor. This in turn supported participatory, stakeholder-owned
            decision-making processes and structures for natural resource
            management on land in the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve for which
            titles were recently awarded in favour of the indigenous
            communities.

          </h6>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            As part of a development partnership with the private sector, the
            project supported the establishment of a sustainable value chain for
            the perfume ingredient liquidambar balsam, also known as styrax
            resin (introduction of minimum standards, sustainability standards,
            fair prices for producers, protection of indigenous rights,
            sustainable forest management etc.). <br />
            <br />
            During the initial phase of this cooperation, the project came
            across the already highly specific draft produced by external
            consultants to the ICF for creating a national park on the territory
            of the Pech people, with which local actors were unfamiliar.
            However, a protected area in the national park category would have
            prohibited the extraction of styrax resin, thus violating the
            traditional rights of use enjoyed by the Pech people. There are also
            settlers for whom using water sources in the envisaged protected
            area is crucially important. The project responded by launching a
            consultation process, which led to the use of liquidambar at
            community level being declared an element of cultural heritage, and
            the 34,000-hectare forest area being designated the Montaña El
            Carbón Anthropological Reserve (rather than a national park). This
            is the first indigenous protected area in Honduras that allows
            nature conservation to be combined with the protection of indigenous
            rights and traditional practices under the co-management of the
            national forestry administration and the Pech. Together with the
            local population a plan was drawn up for the sustainable management
            of styrax resin on 19,500 hectares of forest land.

                Implementing the complex consultation process and the planning
                events based on it led to the target group clearly identifying
                with the project and, over the course of time, to a solid
                foundation of trust between German development cooperation
                activities and the indigenous peoples. This point is crucial in
                implementing the project in a setting which is otherwise
                characterised by mistrust.

              <li className="p-1">
                The consultation process (which also involved government
                representatives) also paved the way for promoting dialogue
                between indigenous peoples and government agencies. This was
                only possible because the project was seen as an impartial
                moderator (with no agenda of its own) and was able to build
                trust.

                The issue of whether and to what extent indigenous leaders or
                organisations are mandated by the communities they represent
                needs to be addressed. Repeated consultations between indigenous
                leaders and their grass roots on specific points make a
                consultation process very cumbersome.
              </li>
              <li className="p-1">
                The issues identified during the consultation process should
                during the process itself be clearly sorted into those which the
                project can address and those which clearly go beyond its scope.
                Otherwise there is a risk that the project may create
                expectations among the local population which cannot be met.

                Aligning state institutions and rules for forest management with
                the indigenous context, as for instance in the case of communal
                forest ownership made possible by the new forest standard, is an
                important factor in facilitating cooperation with indigenous
                groups

                Partly also as a result of the project activities, the
                indigenous groups recognised that developing management plans
                and entering into forest use agreements with government
                institutions provides a legal foundation on which to protect
                territories against illegal settlement, illegal sale and
                over-exploitation. Whether and how the local and indigenous
                structures are themselves able to curb environmental crime

                Difficult political circumstances (such as those which arose in
