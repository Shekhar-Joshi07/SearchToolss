            National Protected Area on the Viet Nam border was established in
            1993. The unique karst landscape is one of the largest in the world
            and is tremendously important to biodiversity – forests, wetlands,
            limestone formations and cave systems offer many species a habitat,
            including a host of endemic flora and fauna. <br />
            <br />
            The region is also situated in the country’s poorest district.
            Around the protected area are 18 villages with some 8,000
            inhabitants, many of whom belong to ethnic minorities. The mostly
            very poor population derives much of its food and household supplies
            from the natural resources in the HNN National Protected Area.

          <h4>&gt;&gt; CHALLENGES</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The HNN National Protected Area is managed at district level and its
            protection status is enshrined in law. The area is extremely
            difficult to access, the management team has only a small number of
            staff (just 9 to 12 employees initially) and very few financial and
            technical resources at its disposal, and sustainable funding has not
            been secured <br />
            <br />
            The pressure on the protected area’s resources (wood, non-timber
            forest products and wild animals) is high due to increasing demand,
            but mostly as a result of external parties (from Viet Nam and other
            Laotian regions) exploiting the area illegally. The economic
            alternatives for the local population are slim due to the karst
            landscape and the many unexploded bombs still present in the area{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            With the help of several organisations, an initial management plan
            based on a co-management approach was developed in{" "}
            <a href="https://www.iucn.org/content/hin-namno-national-protected-area-co-management-plan">

            </a>
            . However, it could not be implemented forcefully due to a lack of
            resources. Although awareness of the opportunities and the need for
            a participatory management approach was generally widespread, there
            was no common understanding of what an approach of this kind
            actually meant. Likewise, there was no common understanding among
            all the actors before the project began regarding the protection
            objectives and use regulations. The zoning carried out up to that
            point had not been based on legal requirements and had not
            considered the villages’ traditional rights of use.

          <h4>&gt;&gt; APPROACH</h4>

          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The project is based on co-management principles. Among other
            things, this allows the close relationship between the area and the
            people who spent years hiding in the caves there during the war to
            also be considered. <br />

            </a>{" "}
            was launched in an effort to establish a common understanding of the
            co-management concept and forge an effective partnership between the
            protected area administration and the local communities. In
            connection with this, the project also supported a process of
            evaluating the management effectiveness on the basis of a version of
            the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) adapted to the
            local context. The evaluation based on questionnaires, in
            particular, is something that could be repeated annually as it is
            simple and cost-effective. All co-management partners are involved
            in the process and can voice their opinions in group discussions.
            Weaknesses can be identified and measures derived from this can be
            incorporated into the next plan of operations. <br />
            <br />
            The governance assessment process uncovered what more needs to be
            done in order to develop an effective co-management approach:

          <h4>&gt;&gt; PARTICIPATORY ZONING</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The area underwent a process of re-zoning based on the knowledge of
            the locals and their customary rights. <br />
            <br />
            Maps were created with the villages using trail-mapping, GPS
            training and field surveys. The different use areas were plotted on
            the map – those for the local people’s own needs (non-timber forest
            products, construction timber, hunting, fishing) and inaccessible
            areas and other areas which they would set aside for protecting
            biodiversity. This also led to the protected area being divided into
            totally protected zones and controlled use zones as required by law.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            This process generated a great deal of understanding on both sides

            </a>{" "}
            . The participatory process and the associated selection of main
            routes for regular monitoring laid the foundation for a clear
            agreement about the use areas and the responsibilities of the
            villages.

          </h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            Initially, the villages were looking for a few people with time,
            interest and knowledge of the area to appoint as potential future
            rangers. They were given further training to carry out the trail{" "}
            <a href="https://www.giz.de/de/downloads/giz2014-en-trail-mapping-hin-nam-no.pdf">

            . The village rangers (now 116) will be paid a performance-based fee
            for undertaking biomonitoring and patrols at a later stage pages 20
            –21. <br />
            <br />
            It is important that there are additional rangers from outside the
            local area to punish violations of the law. Village rangers are not
            permitted to inform on, let alone arrest their neighbour. In the HNN
            National Protected Area, the village rangers are also accompanied by
            police or soldiers from the village to enable them to combat even
            well equipped poachers <br />
            <br />
            As the village rangers know the area like the back of their hand
            because of their past, they are also more willing to venture into
            difficult and remote areas than external rangers are. The locals who
            are involved in managing the protected area in this way get an
            additional or alternative source of income and are a more efficient
            and cost-effective solution for the authority. Long-term funding
            does, however, need to be found for this.

            instrument was used as a basis for collecting data in a way that is
            adapted to the local context (patrolling, area data, sighting
            species, poaching, etc.). The rangers and the park staff were
            trained in using this tool. As many of the rangers have only limited
            reading and writing skills, the method for entering data into the
            log was simplified and given a code. Trained park staff enter the
            data gathered into the database, analyse it and develop
            recommendations for the management. Collecting data which feeds into
            the continued management of the area raises the awareness and boosts
            the motivation of the employees. <br />

          <h4>&gt;&gt; COLLABORATIVE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The management structure of the HNN National Protected Area with its
            technical units was established in 2013 with the help of the
            National University of Laos. This was the beginning of and the basis
            for creating the governance structure. The two structures are
            closely connected in this case. <br />
            <br />
            Co-management committees were elected in all 18 villages. Their
            members are officially confirmed by the district governor, giving
            them a formal mandate (e.g. monitoring by village rangers). Regular
            communication ensures that feedback is given to the technical unit.
            There are also co-management committees at village-cluster and
            district level, where the representatives at village level
            (bottom-up) and those from higher positions (top-down) present their
            ideas. This gives all stakeholders the chance to express their needs
            and play a role in the decision-making process. <br />
            <br />
            The clusters were abolished as part of an administrative review of
            the management structure in 2018. However, a new form of village
            representation at district level is now being discussed because
            being integrated into regular administrative legislation is vital
            for their continued existence.

        <div className="pt-2 pb-4">
          <h4>&gt;&gt; CO-MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The first drafts for agreements on use regulations and
            responsibilities for protection have been drawn up at village
            meetings in conjunction with an impartial moderator. A standardised
            co-management agreement was reached at a joint workshop. After
            various meetings and discussion panels, this agreement was
            officially approved by the district governor and shared with all 18
            villages in the immediate vicinity of the park and with other
            surrounding villages, as well as with the authorities and rangers of
            the neighbouring Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park in Viet Nam. <br />
            <br />
            The system of these agreements also works well because the villages
            have a vested interest in keeping people from other villages away
            from the areas that only they can use. It creates a sense of
            ownership as it makes them proud to have the right and the duty to
            protect their areas from others. In order to clarify violations of
            rights of use between the villages and to firm up the regulations,
            providing external support (mediation) to the village authorities
            may be important.
