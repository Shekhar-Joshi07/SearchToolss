          <h4>&gt;&gt; CONTEXT</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The Taï National Park in the south-west of Côte d’Ivoire and Comoé
            National Park in the north-east are both UNESCO World Heritage
            Sites; each forms the core zone of the biosphere reserve of the same
            name. The Taï National Park, which covers an area of 5,500 km2 , is
            the last major intact rainforest in West Africa, providing a haven
            for many threatened species. The Comoé National Park is one of the
            largest protected areas in West Africa. Extending over an area of
            11,500 km2 , it harbours ecosystems from savannahs to dry forests
            with high species diversity.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the wake of the political unrest at the start of the millennium,
            the national parks were increasingly targeted by poachers and gold
            diggers; the impacts of this exploitation are still visible. Both
            protected areas have also come under significant pressure as a
            result of population growth, migration, illegal land use, the
            expansion of export-oriented agricultural production, livestock
            farming and inappropriate agricultural practices – problems that
            cannot be adequately addressed by the local park management bodies
            on their own. <br />
            <br /> The ecosystems of the biosphere reserves provide the basis
            for agriculture in the region. Both parks help to improve the local
            microclimate and the regulation of water and thus help safeguard
            agricultural production in the vicinity of the parks. Palm oil and
            rubber are grown around the Tai National Park and about 15% of the
            world's cacao is produced in this area. The stable microclimate
            secures the production activities and the incomes of nearly 200,000
            smallholders and their families. Despite this, 40% of the local
            population lives below the poverty line. <br />
            <br />
            From 2002 onwards, the division of the country induced by political
            conflict severely restricted management of the Comoé National Park.
            This led to poaching, gold digging and intensive use of water and
            grazing resources by herders that had such a detrimental impact on
            the area that in 2003 UNESCO placed the park on the list of World
            Heritage Sites in Danger. The expansion of cashew production is
            further exacerbating the pressure.

        <div className="pt-2 pb-4">
          <h4>&gt;&gt; MAIN CHALLENGES</h4>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The agricultural sector, which is the country’s chief source of
            income, uses and simultaneously jeopardises the ecosystem services
            provided by the national parks. The population and stakeholders in
            agricultural value chains have little incentive to participate in
            protecting the national parks. There is insufficient shared
            understanding of protection goals and usage regulations. The
            management capacities of the responsible protected area authorities
            are technically sufficient for the primary task of protection but
            not for development measures in the adjoining zones. Long-term
            financing of the protection of the two national parks has been
            provisionally secured from the Ivorian foundation for protected
            areas to meet the primary objective of protection. However, this
            cannot cover all the measures and investment required, such as
            environmental education and development activities in the peripheral
            zones.

            &gt; STRENGTHENING THE PARK AUTHORITIES AND IMPROVING MANAGEMENT AND
            GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES{" "}
          </h6>

          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            Both for biosphere reserves as model regions for sustainable
            development and for national parks/World Heritage Sites, it is
            imperative that the pertinent protected area authorities and the
            responsible regional governments have a common vision for
            sustainable development. Each must be involved in the formulation of
            the other’s development strategies to ensure that the protected area
            becomes an integral part of the region. <br />
            <br /> The relevant local stakeholders must also be integrated in
            governance and management structures. Although the intersectoral
            park management committees formed have only a consultative role,
            they play a part in reviewing local agreements between the park
            authorities and local user groups on the management of natural
            resources in the economic area around the protected areas. This is
            to ensure that these agreements are subsequently observed. The
            involvement of local administrative bodies and the population has
            made a major contribution to the success of the now significantly
            improved management of the protected areas. <br />
            <br />
            Another important factor in this regard was the strengthening of
            capacities within the protected area authorities. For example, park
            staff were trained in monitoring with SMART and provided with
            equipment. Particular attention is paid to poaching, illegal land
            takeovers and fire monitoring <br /> <br /> Thanks to these efforts,
            the Comoé Park is now significantly better protected and its
            ecosystems are slowly recovering. Consequently, Comoé has after 14
            years been removed from the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in
            Danger
          </div>
          <h6 className="text-center pt-4">
            &gt;VALUE CHAINS AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS
          </h6>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            A cornerstone of the project is support for poverty reduction by
            boosting income from sustainable agriculture in the areas around the
            periphery of the parks. As part of this approach, five value chains
            incorporating improved production methods have been promoted. With a
            focus on cacao, cassava (Taï) and cashews, onions and rice (Comoé),
            the project has initiated nine public-private partnership (PPP)
            measures with agro-industrial companies. <br />
            <br />
            The local park management committees play a major part in this
            context. In contrast to the park authorities, the members of these
            committees, which include local authorities, have a mandate to
            develop the peripheral zones. They can therefore promote sustainable
            agricultural value chains in the peripheral zones and can help
            include private farms and agro-industrial businesses in the vicinity
            of the protected areas in the protection strategies.

          <h6 className="text-center pt-4">
            &gt; ASSESSING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
          </h6>
          <div className="container p-4 py-2">
            The many different services that protected areas provide for people
            are fundamental to the livelihoods of the population of the areas
            surrounding the parks. Making the government and the private sector
            aware of the benefits of ecosystem services can help raise the
            necessary funds for conservation of the protected areas. <br />
            <br /> An ecosystem services assessment was conducted in the Taï
            National Park, triggered by the business plan’s projection of a
            funding gap of 6.8 million euros for implementation of the
            management plan for 2014 – 2020. Important steps in this process
            were:
            <br /> <br />
            <ul>
              <b>Defining the scope of the assessment:</b> The concept and its
              relevance to the fundraising effort were presented at an initial
              stakeholder workshop. The workshop was also designed to bring
              stakeholders representing a wide range of interests on board to
              support the assessment. As a first step, working groups discussed
              the various ecosystem services in relation to their ‘recipients’;
              the services considered included ecosystem services of public
              interest (government), those that affect economic activities
              (private sector) and those of interest to (international) donors
              in the nature conservation and development sector. <br />
              <br /> Various services were then selected for a more detailed
              study. Scenarios in the event of sufficient and of insufficient
              funding of the protected area authorities were also drawn up. Even
              a rough outline of this nature can foster a common understanding
              and highlight the urgency of protection measures. <br />
              <br />
              <b>Findings of the assessment:</b> The assessment concentrated on
              three areas: <br />
              <ul>
                <li className="p-1">
                  Regional climate regulation for local households and
                  agricultural production: Although quantifiable analysis was
                  beyond the scope of the study, it can be assumed that
                  large-scale tree-felling in the park would change the climate
                  of the region and hence have a (negative) impact on
                  agricultural production. More than one million people in the
                  area depend on farming for their livelihood: within a radius
                  of about 50 km of the park some 200,000 households cultivate
                  cacao, coffee, palm oil and rubber, mainly for export.
                </li>
                <li className="p-1">
                  Water regulation and supply: Around half a million people
                  benefit from the water resources regulated by the national
                  park (river flows, retention basins, groundwater levels,
                  etc.). The possibility of generating hydropower from rivers
                  whose catchment area lies within the park is a further
                  fundraising argument.
                </li>
                <li className="p-1">
                  Carbon sinks for global climate regulation: The value of the
                  Taï Park as a carbon sink was calculated with the help of an
                  assumed deforestation rate and the price for avoided
                  deforestation agreed by stakeholders in the national REDD+
                  process as an appropriate ‘value for carbon’.
                </li>
              </ul>{" "}
              <br />
              brb
              <b>Using the findings:</b> Effective communication is essential in
              order to impart the findings to the various stakeholders. A range
              of materials was produced for this purpose. In particular, the
              20-page summarising brochure, a plea for the conservation of
              nature and ecosystem services aimed at decision-makers, was widely
              used as an argumentation aid by policy-makers and managers,
              contributing to the following initiatives: <br /> <br />A specific
              plea was addressed to the private sector, focusing on individual
              issues: the value chains for cacao and coffee, rubber and palm oil
              and hydropower, and corporate social responsibility policy in the
              financial and telecommunication sectors. With regard to corporate
              social responsibility, this was directed particularly at companies
              that might be interested in supporting the ‘flagship’ park even
              though they have no direct connection with the area. The
              fundraising itself then concentrated primarily on the cacao
              sector. So far this has resulted in the Ivorian foundation for
              protected areas and the Ivorian park authority signing an
              agreement with the chocolate producer CEMOI and the project
              developer ECOTIERRA on developing zero-emission cacao production
              in the zone bordering the park. The Taï economic area is also a
              focus of the World Cocoa Foundation’s Cocoa & Forests Initiative.
              The initiative, which was set up at the 23rd UN Climate Change
              Conference in 2017, brings together the two largest
              cacao-producing countries – Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana – and 32
              leading cacao-processing companies. <br />
              <br />
              The argumentation has also had an impact on applications and
              grants for climate financing, such as the award of 2 million US
              dollars to promote sustainable management of the Taï National Park
              as part of the World Bank’s Strategic Climate Fund – Forest
              Investment Project (SCF-FIP) agreed in 2018. Furthermore, in 2018
              the Carbon Fund of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF)
              agreed in principle to a proposal by Côte d’Ivoire that is
              designed to enable implementation of an emissions reduction
              programme document (ER-PD) in the Taï economic area and provides
              for the direct acquisition of emission certificates (Emissions
              Reduction Purchase Agreements, ERPAs) to the value of around 45
              million euros between 2020 and 2024 for investments in the
              forestry sector. <br />
